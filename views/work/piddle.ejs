			Piddle is an iPhone app for urine test strip analysis. Using urine test strips can be hard, even for a professional. It requires focus, good timing, handling many things at the same time, but more importantly, the ability to accurately compare colors. Piddle guides you through the process, takes, and tracks the test results. It explains the meaning of each result and shows how your values fall within normal ranges. The results are stored and can be shared with your doctor.</p>

			<p>Urinalysis is an important tool in disease detection, as well as monitoring and screening health. Abnormalities can be indicative of diseases of the urinary system as well as other organ systems, including liver function, and carbohydrate metabolism. Chemical evaluation of urine can be measured using commercially available in house dipstick tests. The app currently works with Multistix® 10 SG Reagent Strips. The strips can perform analyses on blood, bilirubin, glucose, ketones, pH, protein, specific gravity, urobilinogen, leukocytes, and nitrite.</p>
