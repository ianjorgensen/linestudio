			<p>Clamark is a app, is the beginning of a revolution. A lab in your pocket. We got approached by Calmark AB, t build an app that would measure and quantify the colourimetric reaction in their disposable in vitro diagnostic blood separation card, Hilda Neo. Applying blood to the card will create a colour reaction in the assay which is measured by the phones camera and translated to values of LDH and Bilirubin. The work we did for them included conceptualising, design and development of the app, the colour balancing, and built standard colour curves for their chemical. We also are providing on going support during regulatory phases for Medical device classification. Currently the app is in clinical trials and being tested in Sweden and Vietnam.</p>

			<p>When a baby is born they are tested for many things but there are a few indicators that indicate urgent needs of the baby. LDH is an intracellular enzyme found in all cells. Causes of high LDH in new borns is typically an indicator of perinatal asphyxia, hypotension, lymphoma, myocardial infarctions and a few others. The hilda neo card and app take 5 minutes total and provides a specific diagnostic that tells the nurse or doctor if a babies LDH levels are high. If they are high, the nurse can then look specifically into different possible problems to find out the cause. The LDH number is important to know immediately - it is similar to how we use fevers as an indicator of an illness, they are usually an indicator of something else - they are an important warning sign from the body.</p>

			<p>The app contains all the information you need to know about the hilda Neo card. A tutorial guides you smoothly through running the test, you will find information about how the card works and why your using it, what LDH is and why it is a critical indicator of the health of a new born baby. </p>

			<p>After testing the results are stored and accessible at any time. You are able to email results within a trusted network. The color of the result indicates if the result is within range or not. The result expands to see more information about LDH or Bilirubin.</p>

We did everything from putting lab coats on handling pippets and blood samples to user research and designing the flow and experience for the app. Here, on the left is Ian at Calmarks's lab in Stockholm doing test for the colourimetric reaction.</p>
