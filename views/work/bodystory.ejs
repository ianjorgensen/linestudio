			<p>Body Story is an iPhone app that allows users to track and understand recurring medical symptoms.The importance of monitoring personal health is oftentimes overshadowed by the complexity of resources and tools involved in healthcare. Body Story streamlines the process of health monitoring through an interface that enables users to keep a record of their symptoms with simple inputs.</p>

		<p>The entry screen also allows users to create custom groups of symptoms that represent a similar occurrence. Although Body Story suggests common symptom categories through an autocomplete feature, a user can overwrite a suggestion with a custom group name and continue tracking symptoms within the group over time.</p>
		<p>The information is added through a tap on an interactive outline of a human body. This allows users to quickly indicate the physical location of their symptom and, if necessary, proceed to add more information. In the following steps, users have the option to add notes, images or sounds and record the level of pain. Doctor’s visit tags make it possible to track doctor’s notes and diagnoses that are so often forgotten or misplaced by patients.</p>
