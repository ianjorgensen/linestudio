			<p>Working closely with the Hilda Neo card the Calmark app uses basic colorimetry to provide a diagnostic number for measuring LDH and Billiruben. Currently the app is in clinical trials and being user tested in Vietnam. It works in almost any lighting conditions because of the color reference on the hilda Neo card.</p>

			<p>When a baby is born they are tested for many things but there are a few indicators that indicate urgent needs of the baby. LDH is an intracellular enzyme found in all cells. Causes of high LDH in new borns is typically an indicator of perinatal asphyxia, hypotension, lymphoma, myocardial infarctions and a few others. The hilda neo card and app take 5 minutes total and provides a specific diagnostic that tells the nurse or doctor if a babies LDH levels are high. If they are high, the nurse can then look specifically into different possible problems to find out the cause. The LDH number is important to know immediately - it is similar to how we use fevers as an indicator of an illness, they are usually an indicator of something else - they are an important warning sign from the body.</p>

			<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>
